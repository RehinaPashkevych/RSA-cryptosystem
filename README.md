# RSA-cryptosystem
The RSA algorithm employs a truly random number generator (TRNG) that derives its randomness from the unpredictable variations in lightning conditions.The TRNG is based on article on [ResearchGate: Rongzhong Li, “A True Random Number Generator algorithm from digital camera image 
noise for varying lighting conditions”, Southeast Con, pp. 1-8, 2015](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/283021854_A_True_Random_Number_Generator_algorithm_from_digital_camera_image_noise_for_varying_lighting_conditions). This TRNG captures the fluctuations in lightning patterns and utilizes them to generate random values. These random values serve as the foundation for generating the prime numbers used in RSA encryption. By leveraging the inherent randomness of lightning, the TRNG enhances the security of RSA encryption by ensuring that the prime numbers chosen are highly unpredictable, making it harder for attackers to decipher the encrypted data.
